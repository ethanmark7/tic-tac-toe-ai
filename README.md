# tic-tac-toe-ai
My first attempt at a tic tac toe ai using the minimax algorithm.

This project took me a little over 4 hours and it wouldn't have been possible without Sebastian Lague. If you are making your own tic-tac-toe AI I highly recommend you check out his YT video BEFORE you begin. Also, get yourself some paper and pens!
